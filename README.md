## üì¶ Distribution

SnakeFlex compiles to a single binary with no dependencies (except Python on the target system). Perfect for:

* **Sharing demos** - Send the binary + your Python scripts
* **Educational environments** - Complete development environment in one binary
* **Client presentations** - Professional Python script demonstrations with file management
* **Remote execution** - Lightweight server for Python development

* **Secure deployment** - Production-ready with security controls

```bash
# Build for your platform
go build -o snakeflex

# Development package (full features)
mkdir my-python-workspace
cp snakeflex my-python-workspace/
cp *.py my-python-workspace/
cp terminal.html my-python-workspace/
cp -r data/ my-python-workspace/  # Include data directories

# Production package (secure mode)
mkdir secure-deployment
cp snakeflex secure-deployment/
cp production_script.py secure-deployment/
cp terminal.html secure-deployment/
echo './snakeflex --file production_script.py --disable-file-manager --port 8080' > secure-deployment/start.sh
chmod +x secure-deployment/start.sh

# Package and distribute
zip -r python-workspace.zip my-python-workspace/
zip -r secure-deployment.zip secure-deployment/
```

## üîß How it works

SnakeFlex uses WebSockets for real-time bidirectional communication between your browser and Python process, plus a REST API for file management operations (when enabled). It automatically detects when your script needs input and presents a clean interface for interaction.

The Go server intelligently detects your system's Python installation (`python`, `python3`, or `py`) and runs scripts with proper buffering settings to ensure real-time output. File operations are secured to prevent access outside the working directory, and can be completely disabled for maximum security.

**Architecture:**
* **WebSocket connection** - Real-time terminal communication
* **REST API** - File management operations (optional)
* **Security layer** - Path validation, access control, and feature disabling
* **Multi-platform support** - Adaptive Python detection

## üé® Features in action

**Interactive input detection:**

```python
name = input("What's your name? ")  # Input box appears automatically
age = int(input("How old are you? "))  # Handles any input type
```

**Real-time output:**

```python
import time
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Processing step {i+1}...")
    time.sleep(1)  # You see each line as it prints
```

**File operations** (Full Mode only):

```python
# Upload data.csv through the file manager
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')  # File is now available to your script
print(df.head())

# Results can be saved and downloaded
df.to_csv('results.csv')  # Use file manager to download results
```

**Error handling:**

```python
print("This goes to stdout")
print("This goes to stderr", file=sys.stderr)  # Different colors
raise Exception("Errors are highlighted")
```

## üêõ Known limitations

* Windows doesn't support full PTY (pseudo-terminal) features
* Very long-running scripts might timeout in some browsers
* File I/O operations in Python scripts access the server's filesystem
* Large output bursts are throttled to prevent WebSocket flooding
* File uploads are limited to 32MB by default (Full Mode only)
* Hidden files and system directories (`.git`, `__pycache__`) are filtered from the file browser
* Secure mode completely disables file management - no partial restrictions

## üí° Pro tips

### Terminal Tips (Both Modes)
* Use `print(..., flush=True)` for immediate output in custom scripts
* Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop long-running scripts
* Check the browser console (F12) for debugging WebSocket issues
* Use `--verbose` flag to debug script execution and input handling

### File Management Tips (Full Mode Only)
* **Drag and drop** files directly into the upload area for quick uploads
* **Right-click files** to access download and delete options
* **Resize the sidebar** by dragging the right edge for more space
* **Use the refresh button** (üîÑ) to update the file list after external changes
* **Create folders first**, then upload files to organize your workspace
* **Download results** after running data processing scripts

### Security Tips
* **Use `--disable-file-manager`** for production deployments
* **Test in Full Mode**, deploy in Secure Mode for safety
* **Monitor logs** with `--verbose` in secure environments
* **Container isolation** - Run in Docker for additional security layers
* **Network restrictions** - Use firewall rules to limit access

### Development Tips
* Built binaries are portable - no Go installation needed on target machines
* Multiple concurrent output streams are handled safely (stdout + stderr)
* File operations provide real-time feedback in the terminal (Full Mode)
* The current Python script file is protected from accidental deletion
* Secure mode provides the same terminal experience with zero file management risk
